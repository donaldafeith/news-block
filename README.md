# News Tech Block

## Overview
The News Tech Block plugin adds a Gutenberg block to display tech or WordPress-related news from NewsAPI. This dynamic block fetches articles via a PHP render callback, supports pagination, and leverages a custom REST request with a proper User-Agent header.

## Installation
1. Copy the `news-block` folder into your `wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin via the WordPress admin Dashboard under **Plugins**.

## Configuration
1. **API Key:**  
   To securely define your NewsAPI key, add the following line to your `wp-config.php`:
   ```php
   define( 'NEWS_TECH_BLOCK_API_KEY', 'your-api-key-here' );
   ```
   *Note:* A fallback key is provided for development purposes but should be removed in production. Please obtain your own API key from [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/).

2. **User-Agent Header:**  
   The plugin sends a custom User-Agent header with each API request. Adjust it in `news-tech-block.php` if needed.

## Usage
1. **Adding the Block:**  
   In the Gutenberg editor, add the "Tech News" block from the Widgets category.
2. **Block Editing:**  
   The editor displays a preview fetched via JavaScript. This preview is powered by `block.js`.
3. **Front-End Display:**  
   When the page is saved, the block's PHP render callback (in `news-tech-block.php`) displays news articles along with pagination controls.
4. **Pagination:**  
   The block limits articles to 5 per page by default. Use the provided Previous/Next links to navigate between pages.

## Customization
- **Query Parameters:**  
  Modify the search query or pagination settings in the PHP file (`news-tech-block.php`) to adjust the results.
- **Styling:**  
  Customize appearances by editing `style.css`.
- **Editor Behavior:**  
  Adjust block behavior in the editor by modifying `block.js`.
- **Change the News Subject:**  
  To change the subject of news articles, open the file `news-tech-block.php` and locate the `q` parameter in the API URL. For instance, change:
  
  ```php
  'q' => 'wordpress',
  ```
  
  to your desired subject:
  
  ```php
  'q' => 'your-subject-here',
  ```
  
  Update the subject as needed and save the file.

## Troubleshooting
- If the block shows "No articles available" or an error message, verify the API key and inspect the API response.
- Ensure your serverâ€™s PHP configuration supports SSL. The plugin disables SSL verification for remote requests; update as necessary.
- Review the browser console and WordPress debug logs for additional error details.
